Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Exercise Dataset üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the exercise dataset, a popular sample dataset from the Seaborn library. The project's objective was to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between exercise type, diet, and pulse rate using visual and statistical exploration.

Project Summary
The analysis focused on understanding how various factors influence a person's pulse rate. The key findings include:

Exercise Type: A strong positive correlation exists between exercise intensity and pulse rate. Running led to the highest pulse rates, while resting resulted in the lowest.

Diet: The type of diet (low fat vs. no fat) had a subtle but noticeable impact, with the no fat group showing slightly higher pulse rates.

Time: Pulse rates consistently increased over time during physical activity, indicating a sustained physiological response.
